upload the docker ipk to software uploads

after installation of docker: assign the sd card storage to docker files and space needed for docker:

1- cd /etc/docker
2- nano daemon.json
3- edit the json  for the "data-root":"/media/<name of sd card>/docker 

for connecting to the internet through wifi on the laptop:

1- share the internet from the wifi to Ethernet1
configure the network on the PLC as such:
2- ip address in the range of laptop ethernet; eg. 192.168.137.12
3- set Default Gateway after the laptop Ethernet IP address ( it uses DHCP server on windows to get the ip address and DNS
in the internet, so it uses laptop ethernet port as gateway to reach DHCP server )
4- for DNS resolving we use the ip address of the laptop ethernet to set a New Server ip
5- on routing we enable the IP Forwarding

NO need to have a static route to gateway
